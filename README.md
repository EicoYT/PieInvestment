While Investing into stocks I have realized that not that many brokers have Pies, one of the biggest broker called Interactive Broker does not have Pies.
My current Broker called Trading212 does have pies but you cannot change your primary currency to USD if you live in Europe so I have to invest with my currency into US Stocks
and then I get charged FX Fees (Currency Conversion Fees) which heavily influence my investment over longer times, for my Nvidia stock the FX Fees are already 6 CHF.
Because of that I wanted to create this project so I can make Pies and invest with USD to remove the FX Fees.
I plan on making it so you can actually execute orders through this program, for example Interactive Broker has good API Support. 
Sadly my Broker(Trading212) does have API Key but the primary feature that I need isn't implemented yet so I will focus on making this program and once Im happy I will start implementing Interactive Broker.
