While Investing into stocks I have realized that not many Brokers(Trading Platforms) have Pies. One of the biggest Broker called Interactive Broker does not have Pies.
My current Broker called Trading212 does have pies but you cannot change your primary currency to USD if you live in Europe 
so I have to invest with my countrys currency(CHF, its the currency of Switzerland) into US Stocks
and if I do that I get charged FX Fees (Currency Conversion Fees) which heavily influence my investment over longer times. 
My Gain for Nvidia is at 41 CHF but that excludes the FX Fees, with the FX Fees the actual profit is 36.
Because of that I wanted to create this project so I can make Pies and invest with USD to remove the FX Fees.
I plan on making it so you can actually execute orders through this program, for example Interactive Broker has good API Support. 
Sadly my Broker(Trading212) does have API Key but the primary feature that I need isn't implemented yet because of that reason
I will focus on making this program without API Keys after that I will start implementing Interactive Broker.
