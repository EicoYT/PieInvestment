While Investing into stocks I have realized that not that many brokers have Pies, one of the biggest broker called Interactive Broker does not have Pies.
My current Broker called Trading212 does have pies but you cannot change your primary currency to USD if you live in Europe which means I have to invest with my currency into US Stocks
which then charges me FX Fees (Currency Conversion Fees) which heavily influence my investment over longer times because you always see your return of the stock and the your Fx Fees for my Nvidia stock the FX Fees are already 6 CHF
because of that I wanted to create this project so I can make Pies and invest with USD to remove the FX Fees. It was also a good project to refresh my memory on Programming.
I plan on making it so you can actually execute orders through this program, for example Interactive Broker has good API Support. Sadly my Broker(Trading212) does have API Key but the key feature that I need isnt implemented yet.
